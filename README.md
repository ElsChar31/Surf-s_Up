1.	Overview
  a.	The analysis was performed to compare the months of June and December. 
  b.	W. Avy must learn from the analyst which month’s temperatures will maximize the company’s economic viability and the month that will make revenue-generation        difficult given the temperature readings generated from the coding.
2.	Results
3.	Summary
  a.	One query this analyst would run is an analysis comparing humidity readings between the months of June and December. The commonality that temperature and humidity possess is that when both reach levels deemed intolerable by consumers, W. Avy’s patronage will invest their resources in business entities that the customers believe will best aid in their tolerance of these atmospheric conditions.
  b.	The second query this analyst would run is a revenue comparison between March and September. The results would substantiate whether temperatures experienced by consumers affect the patronage levels experienced by W. Avy’s business.
